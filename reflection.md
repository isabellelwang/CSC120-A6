- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I find Inheritance a lot more efficient and concise. For example, I didn't have to add new attributes into the subclasses that overlap with Building, and instead called on super(). I also think it makes programming a lot more organized and clearer, because the code is neatly sorted into different classes. 

What worked was calling on the super class constructor for each subclass and then initializing the specific attributes of each subclass after. I also think the program is able to work well without crashing or freezing. I was also able to use the Java documentation to guide me along using a Hashtable. I found it confusing to print out the individual keys and values of the Hashtable, but when I was working with Dani Justo, I learned about the toString() method which printed out the title of the book and the checkout status. Another thing that didn't work was in the Cafe class in the sellCoffee method, this.nCups cannot be this.nCups -= 1 and I had to write it as this.nCups = this.nCups - 1;. Otherwise it would say the value is not used. One advice I would give someone in the future is to use the Java documentation when coding, because it has been really helpful with constructing a Hashtable for the Library class for me.
